# hangman

It is necessary to guess the letters of an unknown word of a certain length. This word needs to be guessed by clicking on the letters from the keyboard. When the wrong letter is entered, "wrong letters" appear on the screen and a limb of the hanged man appears on the screen. When the correct letter is entered, the word field to be guessed is filled. When the same letter is entered, a warning message will appear for 2 seconds and nothing will be done.

If the word can be guessed before the man is hanged, you will receive a "kazandiniz" and "tekrar oyna" popup. If the word is not known, the "kaybettiniz" popup, the "tekrar oyna" popup and the correct word are printed on the screen. When you click play again, a new word appears and the game starts over.
